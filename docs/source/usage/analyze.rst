Analyzing an Image
==================


.. warning::
   Most of these components save the output only on the backend of the application.
   This must be changed in future iterations, so users of the frontend have access
   to the results!


This tab contains a number of functions that were specifically 
implemented for the analysis of astrocytes and nerve fibers in brain 
images. 

Detecting astrocytes
--------------------
.. note:: 
  This Function is specialized for fluorescent brain images taken on 
  the GFAP channel, as this channel depicts astrocytes among other 
  things.

New training data can be generated through segmentation 
of an image followed by manual sorting of the resulting regions 
into:

* 'astrocyte'
* 'artifact', 
* 'clumps_artifact'
* 'clumps_astrocyte'
* 'clumps_mixed'

.. warning::
  The script for generating training data runs on the server and 
  is not fully integrated with the frontend yet. The generated 
  images are saved to the folder 
  `model\\astrocytes\\train_data\\new_training_regions` inside the 
  docker container of the backend and need to be sorted there.

If "Open diagram" is checked, a website will be opened, which will 
show the present prediction of regions. This can help with manual 
labelling.

As soon as labelled trainig data exists, a Random Forest Classifier 
can be trained on this data. The classifier can then be used to 
predict occurrences of astrocytes in unlabelled images.

The channel for which objects are predicted can be manually set. 

Additionally, the amount of iterations can be increased to get 
predictions for clumps despite their rare occurrence.

.. warning::
   "Save preprocessed images" will currently only save images 
   into the backend docker container.

Calculating orientation
-----------------------

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Segmensation/segmensation-docs/main/source/img/analyze_orientation_1.jpg
   :alt: image of GUI

This function divides an image into smaller patches and 
calculates the preferential direction for each patch through the 
directionality plugin that is included in Fiji.

.. note:: 
  More information on how the directionality plugin works can be 
  found `here <https://imagej.net/plugins/directionality>`_.

The results can be downloaded as CSV files.

.. warning::
   "Save preprocessed images" will currently only save images 
   into the backend docker container.

After calculating the orientation of an image, a visual 
representation of the results can be generated.

The amount of patches and for big stitchings the tile size has 
to be manually set.

Furtermore, histograms of the images can be generated and it is 
possible to only get the visual representation for a specific 
tile or layer.

Ratio of fibers
---------------

This function calculates the ratio of fibers or astrocytes in an 
image by getting the amount of pixels assigned to objects in each 
channel (AF/MBP (myelin fibers), GFAP (astrocytes)). Pixels that 
are assigned to multiple objects are not taken into account, as 
overlapping structures are not possible in this context.

If the image contains anomalies, such as an inverted channel 
assignment, slices with varied sizes or a black hole - a structure 
that does not contain any fibres - the corresponding checkbox can 
be activated to take the anomaly into account.

Furthermore, the calculation can be limited to specific layers or channels.

.. warning::
   "Save preprocessed images" will currently only save images 
   into the backend docker container.

Threshold and foreground pixels can be calculated and downloaded as 
csv.

Segmentation of fibers
----------------------
.. warning::
   Results will currently be saved into the backend docker container.

This segment offers three different approaches for the segmentation of 
fibers in an image:

**Approach 1**

* Pixel classification through a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier

**Approach 2**

* Pixel classification through a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier
* Segmentation through a threshold method (Otsu's method/mean method)

**Approach 3**

* Removal of large Objects through Otsu's method
* Segmentation of remaining fibers through a threshold method (Otsu's 
  method/mean method)

The approaches have similar parameters: For each approach, the channel 
and slice number of the image can be specified. Approach 1 and 2 also 
need the class number of fibres/objects that should be predicted.

Other
-----

This segment contains the option to create and save a greyscale 
histogram for an image.
