The Random Forest Classifier that was created during Training can 
be used to predict the contents of other images.
For this, select another image from the upload section and run the 
Prediction.

Resulting probability maps can be saved as images and pixel 
probabilities can be saved as CSV.

---------------------------
Hough Circle Transformation can be used to detect circles in images.

The results of the Hough Circle Transformation from the "Training" 
step can be downloaded here.
