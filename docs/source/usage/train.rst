Training
========

Random Forest Classifier
------------------------
Currently there are two modes of Training for the Random Forest 
Classifier: A fast one with medium accuracy and a slow one with 
higher accuracy. The maximum depths of the tree are 10 and 17 
respectively.

Hough Circle Transformation
---------------------------
Hough Circle Transformation can be used to detect circles in images.
In this training config only one Slice of an image can be chosen. 
After  a successfull Hough Transformation the image with its annotations is getting displayed. 

This step is for trying on only one image before using on a whole stack of slices. 

This computed image can be downloaded. 

.. note:: 
    Hough Circle Transformation is an operation that does not 
    require training. It is currently listed under "Training" aswell 
    as under "Prediction". During "Training" the Transformation is 
    calculated and the result is shown. "Prediction" only contains a 
    download option for the results.

Ellipse Detection
---------------------------
Ellipse Detection can be used to detect circular and elliptical shapes in images.

The calculated image annotations can be calculated. 

.. note:: 
   This does not require training. This is a classic detection method.
   First a Canny filter is deployed. On this image all contours are getting found with the algorithm from Suzuki et.al.[TSA]
   Then it fits an ellipse around a set of 2D points. The function calculates the ellipse that fits a set of 2D points created from the contour.
