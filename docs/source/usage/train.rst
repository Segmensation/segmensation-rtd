Hough Circle Transformation
---------------------------
Hough Circle Transformation can be used to detect circles in images.

.. note:: 
    Hough Circle Transformation is an operation that does not 
    require training. It is currently listed under "Training" aswell 
    as under "Prediction". During "Training" the Transformation is 
    calculated and the result is shown. "Prediction" only contains a 
    download option for the results.
