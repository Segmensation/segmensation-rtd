Building frontend executable
========

To create a executable from the frontend you have to execute:

``yarn electron:build``

in the folder where you have your frontend ``packet.json`` file.

You should find an executable in the newly created ``dist_electron`` directory

This is not connected to the backend yet(needs to be figured out in some future work),
but you can explore Segmensation already.
